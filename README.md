# Code Climate SCSS-Lint Engine

This is a code climate engine that wraps [`scss-lint`](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint) tool which is a linter for scss/sass.

## Configuration

This engine supports [the same configuration file as scss-lint itself](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint#configuration). If you would like to tweak the results, you can add a `.scss-lint.yml` file to your repository. The default configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/brigade/scss-lint/blob/master/config/default.yml).
